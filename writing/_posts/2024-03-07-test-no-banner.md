# Test Post with No Banner

This is a test post to verify that the "no banner" option works correctly. This post should be displayed without any banner image at the top.

## Purpose of this Test

This post helps verify that:

1. The `banner: false` setting is correctly handled by the build script
2. The generated HTML doesn't include any banner image
3. The layout still looks good without a banner

After confirming this works correctly, we can update the documentation and template to include this option.
