# Post Title Here

Your introduction paragraph goes here. This will be used as the excerpt on the posts listing page if no excerpt is specified in the frontmatter. Keep it concise and engaging.

## Section Heading

Your content goes here. You can use:
- Bullet points
- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- And other Markdown formatting

## Writing Guidelines

1. Use clear, descriptive titles
2. Add relevant tags (2-4 recommended)
3. Include a compelling introduction
4. Break content into logical sections
5. Use proper Markdown formatting

## File Naming

Name your file as: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`
Example: `2024-03-06-building-with-purpose.md`

## Banner System

The website uses a banner system with these options:
- **Default (Dark):** If no banner is specified, the system uses `banner_dark.png` 
- **Light Banner:** Specify `banner_light.png` for lighter content
- **Custom Banner:** Provide a path to your own banner image

## Tips
- Keep your content focused and well-structured
- Use headings to organize your thoughts
- Include relevant images or code examples when helpful
- End with a clear conclusion or call to action
