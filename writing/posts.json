While traditional CDNs speed up the internet by caching data on servers near you, Pipe Network lets you run a node to propagate data. More nodes mean lower latency ‚ö°Ô∏è and you&#39;re rewarded for owning a piece of the network.</p>\n<p>This project represents my ongoing work in making decentralized infrastructure more accessible to everyone. By simplifying the process of running a PoP node, we can expand the network&#39;s reach and improve internet performance globally while enabling more people to participate in the decentralized web. </p>\n",

At Preterag, we&#39;re deeply committed to fostering a vibrant, inclusive community that drives innovation through collaboration.</p>\n<h2>Why Community Matters</h2>\n<p>The strength of open source lies not just in the code, but in the connections and relationships that form around it. Here&#39;s why community is at the heart of everything we do:</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Sharing</h3>\n<p>When developers come together, amazing things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross-pollination of ideas</li>\n<li>Shared learning experiences</li>\n<li>Mentorship opportunities</li>\n<li>Collective problem-solving</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Innovation Through Diversity</h3>\n<p>Different perspectives lead to better solutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cultural diversity</li>\n<li>Technical backgrounds</li>\n<li>Industry experiences</li>\n<li>Unique approaches to problems</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sustainable Growth</h3>\n<p>A strong community ensures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Long-term project viability</li>\n<li>Continuous improvement</li>\n<li>Shared maintenance</li>\n<li>Resilient ecosystems</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Building Together</h2>\n<p>We believe that the best solutions emerge when we:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Listen to each other</li>\n<li>Share our knowledge freely</li>\n<li>Support new contributors</li>\n<li>Celebrate our successes together</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Join Our Community</h2>\n<p>Whether you&#39;re a seasoned developer or just starting your journey, there&#39;s a place for you in our community.
