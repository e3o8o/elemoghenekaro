While traditional CDNs speed up the internet by caching data on servers near you, Pipe Network lets you run a node to propagate data. More nodes mean lower latency ⚡️ and you&#39;re rewarded for owning a piece of the network.</p>\n<p>This project represents my ongoing work in making decentralized infrastructure more accessible to everyone. I believe if we simplify the process of running a PoP node, we can expand the network&#39;s reach and improve internet performance globally while enabling more people to participate in the decentralized web. </p>\n",
